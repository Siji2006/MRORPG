This Java-based text RPG lets you embark on a dungeon adventure where you choose a class (Warrior, Archer, or Wizard) and battle monsters and bosses.
You'll make decisions in combat—such as attacking, defending, dodging, fleeing, or using special powers—while managing your health, mana, and special abilities.
Special powers require mana, which regenerates slowly over time. As you defeat enemies, you'll gain XP, level up, and improve your stats.
The goal is to survive as long as possible by defeating enemies and leveling up.

To run the game:
Install Java (JDK).
Save the code in a file called MRORPG_FinalProject.java.
Compile the code using javac MRORPG_FinalProject.java.
Run the game with java MRORPG_FinalProject.
